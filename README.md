# Go Basics Course

This repository contains my learning journey through Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's "Learn Go (Golang) from the Ground Up" course.

## About

I'm documenting my progress learning Go programming language by sharing code examples and exercises from the course. Each lesson is organized in its own directory with practical examples demonstrating key Go concepts.

## How to Run

Each lesson can be executed by navigating to its directory and running:

```bash
go run main.go
```
